## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹
**To do this challenge, you need a good understanding of HTML and CSS, and basic JavaScript.**

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this news website homepage and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page.
